"Closing things because of Covid-19 has hurt a lot of people, but the deepest and longest-lasting harm has been done to millions of school children.  Can we not prioritize them, even if that puts the livelihoods of some bar and restaurant employees  at risk? I'd even be willing to focus more of my tax dollars towards those businesses we most intentionally must ""harm"" in order to reduce infection rates enough to reopen our schools.",0,1
"Why is this sliding into 2nd amendment kind of ""my rights""....""don't tread on me""....I have a right to choose what I put in my body sound of tiny stamping feet? 

That stance means that I have a right to not do everything possible to stop this deadly disease and- I have the right to infect you and maybe kill you. 
That ""logic"" and selfish -childish -willfulness completely escapes me. 
Corporate leaders, college presidents, airline execs, religious leaders, all leadership  need to step up and take ethical responsibility.",0,1
"I’m fully vaxed and gladly don my very comfortable and well designed KN95 mask (with changeable filters) in most stores. Doesn’t bother me one bit. If I see someone I know I’ll take it off to talk, provided they don’t appear ill.

My young kids play with other young kids, indoors and outdoors.  It’s a risk I’m willing to take because masking is robbing them of their youth and innocence at this point.  They need to see other kids expressions particularly a smile. They’ve already been scarred enough from the pandemic.

Still don’t go to crowded indoor restaurants and events but happy to sit on a patio with anybody who has their shots.  Anti-Vaxers really anger me.   I’m looking forward to seeing my first live concert with 2019 in the fall.  

Navigating the maze of covid safety is a little complicated at this stage. My sense is by the end of the summer science will have more answers and all restrictions will be a memory but indoor masks will stick around for a while so people don’t catch other respiratory illnesses. Not in social gatherings but in public places.

I’m neither Dem nor Rep but usually support the GOP.  DeSantis is probably my favorite politician at the moment and I don’t live in Florida.",0,1
"Expose the antivaxxer crowd as the disruptive ne'er-do-wells they truly are.

Don't let them in the office, in stadiums, stores, schools or restaurants.

Let them enjoy their choices as social pariahs.",0,1
"We have not eaten at a restaurant since early March. We will not eat at a restaurant until there is a safe, effective vaccine available. We are both seniors and it’s just not worth the risk.",1,0
"Last night I learned of 4 individuals who contracted the Delta variant.

Three had received the Pfizer vaccination quite a while back.

All had had Covid earlier on in the pandemic.

Three of the four work together.

The fourth is a baby (she’s doing just fine, the others are feeling “better”.)

11 days after the first positive Delta result, at least one is still testing positive.

All were much sicker than the last bout with Covid.

After inquiring about everyone’s health, I asked why there’s almost no discussion in the news about reinfection (there’s a bit today).

If reinfection is so “rare”, why am I aware of three?

There are a lot of people visiting this city and traveling back to a home near you - every single day.

So, now what do we do?  There are a lot of letters between Delta and Omega…",0,1
"Millions of people have followed every direction and warning and still been infected. Many have died.

It should not be a ""choice"" about whether you could get covid and infect others. A recent Times story reported how a single infected nursing home worker infected dozens and killed several.

Make it mandatory.",0,1
"If you're over 70, obese, diabetic, or any combination thereof, it's probably wise to stay home or wear a hazmat suit when you go out.
Leave everyone else alone.  

If the hospitals begin to get overwhelmed, we can scale back then.  

Your safety is your responsibility.  You are the only one who can put on your gloves, goggles, and mask.  So do it.  

This idea that your mask protects me but doesn't protect you is just ridiculous, unscientific, ludicrous, and ignorant.  Masks don't have some magical one-way weave.  

Of course, the demographic that believes this nonsense (but doesn't wear eye protection) is the same demographic that gets taken by every phone scam and internet scam known to mankind.",0,1
"Given that one of the major risk factors for Covid is obesity, I'd sooner see an exercise mandate than the return of masks.",0,1
"Same goes for second-hand smoke, including from cannabis.",0,1
"Death is one thing. 
Most people aren't bothered by it from Covid because they sense it's rare and will only happen to someone else.

On the other hand, there is the recovery and long-term afflictions that thousands will suffer through over weeks, months and maybe the rest of their lives.

The media is giving us numbers. Please do more to show us how awful Covid-19 is for many people, even though it is only killing a small percentage of us.

If people knew how bad Covid can be for anyone, then they'd stop playing Russian roulette and wear a mask.",0,1
"When I started work at FedEx 28 years ago we weren’t allowed to wear facial hair or visible tattoos. Same for the people I know who worked for Disney. No crying about personal freedoms, libertarian or Trumpism, just compliance if you wanted the job. Now people assume their individual liberties are more important than the health of co-workers and customers. This should be no problem at all. Companies should make note of all those who complain because those are the ones who are not interested in teamwork, your corporate culture or customer service.",0,1
"It’s simple. Wear a mask.  Let’s use the information we do know.  Masks help stop the spread of the virus.  We all want to live the way we once did before Covid.  The world has changed and we must adapt.   The sooner we stop resisting the best science advice the sooner we can be at a healthier, safer world.",0,1
The only masks which are truly effective are N95s. They are medical grade and protect the wearer and those nearby. The rest of the masks are minimally effective. The virus particles are so tiny that they can easily evade the “protection” of cloth and surgical  masks. One might as well slap a piece  of Swiss cheese on one’s face.,0,1
"Shame on the owners for not enforcing masks and distancing.  They do not care about customers or their employees they only care about money.  Sensible people are not participating.   Lesson to employees is get an education, learn a skill so you have more options in life than being a cashier or waiter.",0,1
"I will still wear a good mask in any public store of any type until the pandemic is really, actually over.  Covid is not gone and continues to mutate: the risk is obvious.",0,1
It's funny how people who insist they need to keep an arsenal of weaponry in their home and on their person for their protection now want to scoff at those of us who will choose to continue wearing a thin piece of fabric over our faces to keep us from getting sick.,0,1
"Not going to comment on the science, but as someone who works with the public in a face to face setting, I can tell you that meaningful communication is just so much harder when people have their faces covered.  Its impossible to quantify, but there is certainly some humanity or even joy lost in interacting and I believe that has harmed us all. I think we need to ditch the masks the moment it is safe to do so.",0,1
"If ""herd immunity"" - the vaccination of a minimum of 80% of the public - has not yet been reached, and if it's true that the more virulent and deadly South African/Brazil SARS-Cov2 strain is starting to spread in parts of the US, why in the world would people en masse ditch their masks?",0,1
Let’s stop ignoring the truth- Anti-vaxxers are making people sick.,0,1
"We are all done and ready to move on from Covid but Covid is not done with us yet. We have a choice, either we play the hand we’re dealt and let common sense and compassion prevail and adapt to evolving circumstances or dig our heels in and decide to ignore the circumstances and pay the price for our actions. 

From the beginning it was thought that this would last every bit of 18 months, which takes us to September-ish. 

We’re all tired. We’re all frustrated. But we’re almost there.",0,1
"I don’t think the economics will work for restaurants and bars, in states that allow indoor dining, with restrictions.  Restaurants and bars make money when they pack people in and overturn tables frequently. 

It’s sad, but their business model just does not work in a time of pandemic.  I am sure when NJ eventually allows restaurants to open indoors, (I don’t know if we will allow indoor bars to open before a vaccine), the owners will be happy for a couple of weeks, then they will be pushing for more capacity, which they will not be rightfully given.  

Sadly, we are going to lose a big percentage of our restaurants.  I don’t think it can be helped. I just hope people get out before they throw more good money after bad.   Who knows when we will have an effective vaccine?",1,0
We are experiencing a pandemic.  Give me Big Brother for this one piece of health information until the crisis is over.  I work closely with a small number of other employees in food service.  I would like to be able to minimize my risks.,0,1
"Sanitizing windows seems like a purely symbolic gesture when you consider that the greater way in which the virus is spread indoors is by customers who are unmasked while eating and drinking and talking loudly. All the other cleaning measures are made superfluous by unmasked patrons. Sadly, the only way ahead for restaurants and bars is to remain closed for indoor dining until a vaccine arrives. In the interim, the government urgently needs to find a way to subsidize their wages and rent.",1,0
"Virus variants nullify ""privacy."" No one has the right to harm others in any environment.",0,1
I don’t want to be required to work in close proximity to people who are lethal disease vectors.,0,1
"We continue to frame a civic responsibility issue in terms of personal choice.  This is a mistake.  It's a personal choice to obey traffic laws, but your decision affects others rather dramatically.  Despite our cynicism, I'm still confident enough in Americans that if the messaging were changed completely to aim for civic duty or shared responsibility instead of personal choice, participation rates would rise.  Problem is we're not even trying.",0,1
"All of this inability to think ahead and plan according has ended up costing more money and more lives. I blame the GOP for not paying people to stay home and business to stay closed. I blame the greedy millionaires who took PPP loans and then fired employees anyway. We need intelligent, ethical leadership. Conservatives have proven they don’t belong in government.",0,1
So much security theater while the most vulnerable still lack non-bankruptcy-inducing health care or government assistance to keep them home if sick.,0,1
"We need to step back and review how much credence we've given the crazies - the anti-vaxxers, the big lie believers... Sane folks need to value what is right and ensure that society at large benefits from what is right. Enough coddling the crazies, just because they exist in great numbers. We need to get back into the driver's seat and put the crazies somewhere safe. We will continue to live in pandemic times unless we all comply with sound public health measures - enforced by whatever legal means we have available.",0,1
"My fear is that someone will sue a company for discrimination against its anti-vaxer emloyees by offering incentives.  If the case should reach SCOTUS, the majority, who seem to be science-ignorant, if not downright anti-science, may side with the plaintiffs.  We shall continue our march toward national suicide-by-ignorance.",0,1
"Private companies have the right and the duty to implement safety restrictions to protect all its employees. There is no right to spread a deadly disease! There is no right to work at company X, Y, or Z. A no-vaccer has a choice, an absolute right to work somewhere else!",0,1
"How many times have we heard someone declare “I know my rights” at the top of their lungs. Constitutionality is big, with everyone injecting his or her own interpretation of the term. What so many of us are rejecting is the concept of the common good. Rejecting the vaccine is akin to spitting in your co-worker’s face, in fact stating that you don’t care what happens as long as you get your way. Infantile? Of course, but very much in Vogue in our country these days. No problem rejecting something that would eventually benefit everybody. Too much government! Too much regulation! Too many rules to live by. No authority can tell me what to do! But don’t forget to send me my stimulus check! And, by the way, keep that army of young men and women ready to defend me while I catch a game and have a beer. What has America come to?",0,1
"I have not suffered from a cold or the flu for over a year now.  Hence, I will always wear a mask when I am around lots of people in an enclosed space---stores, crowded sidewalks and such.",0,1
"I’m old enough to have known people crippled by polio. There’s a reason our society makes it incredibly difficult to send your kid to school without a whole schedule of vaccines, and it isn’t government overreach. Many Americans are so outrageously self absorbed that they view any laws necessary for living in an organized society as an affront to their personal sovereignty.",0,1
"Many posts legitimately bemoaning the fact that Americans, unlike most other cultures, tend to put their individual needs - however superficial - before those of their friends, neighbors and community. 
Keep in mind that Americans are relentlessly sold images of individuality and its value, along with absurdly out of proportion doses of “everyone’s a star,” from the second they’re born until the day they die. The act of living has become the acting out commercial programming, cynically generated not only through mainstream media but now social media as well. 
Most people don’t stand a chance against that onslaught, particularly when you factor in the general lack of nuclear family, little regard for nature and spirituality, and arguably one of the least respected educational systems in first and second world countries.",0,1
"Can the NYT confirm whether the delta variant is more deadly? 

There’s “news” making rounds, largely in conservative circles (ron paul tweeted about it) that a UK study showed the delta variant is far less deadly though more transmissible. 

The reports are based on a June 18 report published by Public Health England, and titled “SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England
Technical briefing 16”.  The data is on table 2. Not sure what to make of this and hoping the NYT can help.",0,1
"Carrot and stick mentioned, but mostly carrots, no sticks.  I know my former employer (I’m retired) charged employees extra for health insurance if they were smokers.  I was already an ex-smoker when they implemented this policy, thankfully. Stick. 

And if you gave them a ridiculous amount of information about your lifestyle, medical reports/vital statistics, etc, to a 3rd party vendor (supposedly not shared with employer) you got a discount on your health insurance. Carrot.  Why not something similar? 

I totally support requiring many jobs being required to have them.",0,1
"The Times published a survey a couple of months ago where the political divide on this matter was clear: people who identify as Dems way overestimated the likelihood that a person would be hospitalized with Covid whereas those who identify as Repubs actually were closer to the mark (it pains me to say this!).  I""m convinced at least part of the argument in favor of masks here and elsewhere is political ""virtue signaling"".  In other words, people add a lot of other ""reasons"" into their risk assessment.  Example: I keep hearing how masks helped prevent colds and flus during the season but was it mask wearing during one's probably brief foray into a grocery store that prevented these common ailments or was it the fact that people were working from home, not commuting via crowded public transport (BART in the Bay Area), traveling in plans?  That reality seems more likely to me, not the masks.",0,1
"I went to a Costco without a mask yesterday and felt profoundly uncomfortable. It's back to masking indoors for me. I did mask up at the checkout counter out of courtesy to the staff (even those not masked).  I have been afraid to go back to in-person classes at the gym because exercise in a mask is simply not feasible for me. So it's still virtual for me.

People are confused by the conflicting information being put out by the CDC and the WHO. I think this can be attributed to the need of the CDC to balance health with politics and business/economy considerations, whereas the WHO is about health only. I'm putting my lot in with the WHO, because I honestly don't care about what big business wants.",0,1
"A part of the scientific community is focused on minimizing spread. This article follows their lead. But there are many scientists focused not only on minimizing spread but also on carefully reopening the economy.  Their teachings are more relevant here. 

Those who factor in the value of reopening give less attention to general virus spread and total infection counts because the vast majority who are infected have mild cases. And so they focus on secondary spread.

 A young person who goes to a restaurant isn’t much of an issue if he scrupulously avoids those at risk, including the elderly of course. Avoiding a dangerous secondary transmission is all-important. Bringing back business is worth the price of many mild infections. 

As we reopen, we should not make the mistake of the first wave, when we focused on total infections. Total dangerous infections are what matter. A simple infection is a mild case of the flu. A dangerous infection can be a death sentence. We have been missing the forest for the trees. The 20% of cases that are serious require  the vast majority of our attention. 

We pretty much know who the most vulnerable are, not totally of course, but with enough precision that not protecting the vulnerable, first and foremost, is indefensible. Tracing needs to be taken to the second level. Otherwise, the infection of a teenager looks the same as that of his grandparents.",0,1
"I do not understand how it is pleasurable to eat in a restaurant right now.  I love eating out, but just can’t see that is worth the risk and don’t think I could enjoy my meal.  When our favorite restaurant opened for takeout, my husband went to pick it up and found workers not masked nor keeping six feet apart, and this is at a high end Italian restaurant where a meal with a glass of wine hovers at $100 per couple.  I love to cook and have been using this as an opportunity to experiment with new dishes.  I will wait to go out until we have a vaccine or the virus dies out.",1,0

"Why hasn't this chaos happened to such an extreme degree in our peer countries?

Leadership.

Laws.

Penalties, fines, and consequences.

Societies can't organize themselves for the greater good, especially not a society that emphasizes individualism. That's why we try to build strong institutions and elect competent leaders.

We can complain about ""those people"" all we want, but without leadership, consistency, guidance, and reliance on the experts at the highest levels, we're going to have chaos and a long, long road ahead.

Which is what we have right now. So vote. Make the change you want to see. And wear a mask.",0,1

"I went out for lunch yesterday with a friend. It is the second time I've been out just for fun since March. Both times, my friend and I ate at a restaurant that served us seated outside.  That will not be an option when the weather gets cold. 

I am extremely frustrated by the Trump inspired crowd who believe it is their god given right to not wear a mask. They and their lunacy are destroying this nations credibility. We are considered a major health risk by the rest of the world. 

Currently U.S. citizens with an American passport are allowed to enter only EIGHT countries without any restrictions. There are 23 other countries that’ll let some of us in – but with restrictions and quarantines.",0,1
